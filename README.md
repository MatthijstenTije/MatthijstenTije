#### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm an MSc Data Science student at Tilburg University. While I've always been passionate about Economics, in which I graduated, I've recently discovered the exciting opportunities that coding offers.

ðŸ’¡ My interests have led me to explore artificial intelligence and its applications within the academic setting. Through my work with [tilburg.ai](tilburg.ai), I contribute to developing AI tools and writing articles aimed at guiding students in the responsible use of AI.

ðŸ’» With a background in Economics, I have developed proficiency in R, which I enjoy using for data analysis, visualization, and econometric modeling. I've applied these skills on the open science platform [Tilburg Science Hub](https://tilburgsciencehub.com).

ðŸš€ Feel free to explore my repositories to see the projects I'm currently working on. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
