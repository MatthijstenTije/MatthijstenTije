#### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm an MSc Data Science student at Tilburg University. Although I've always been passionate and graduated in Economics, I've recently discovered the exciting opportunities that coding offers.

ðŸ’¡ My interests have led me to artificial intelligence and its applications inside the university. Through my work with (tilburg.ai)[tilburg.ai], I contribute to developing AI tools and writing articles aimed at guiding students in the responsible use of AI.

ðŸ’» With a background in Economics, I have developed proficiency in R, which I enjoy using for data analysis, visualization, and econometric modeling. I have used this for an open Science platform: (Tilburg Science Hub)[https://tilburgsciencehub.com]

ðŸš€ Feel free to explore my repositories to see the projects I'm currently working on. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
